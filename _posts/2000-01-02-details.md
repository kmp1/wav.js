Currently there is not a whole lot here but it will let you create .wav files in a pretty straightforward way.  The only public function in the module is create, you call it like this:

    var wav = wav.create(1, 44100, wav.BitSize.EIGHT);

- The first argument (1) is the number of channels (e.g. 2 for stereo, 1 for mono, etc)
- The second argument is the [sampling frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28signal_processing%29) in Hz.
- The third argument is just an integer and is the number of bits per sample.  I created a little enumeration since, in theory you could pass anything in here but in practice I am too lazy to figure out the calculations required to deal with anything.  Have a look at the BitSize enumeration for the allowed values.

Now that you have a wave object you can call the handy addSample function on it like so:

    wav.addSample(123);

There are a few methods available on it:

- addSampleToAllChannels - This adds the sample sample to all the output channel
- getDataChunkSize - This gets the size of the data chunk
- getTotalSampleCount - This gets the total number of samples
- getSampleCountInOneChannel - This gets the sample count in a single channel

There is also the, moderately useful, property:

- frequency - This returns the sampling frequency of the wav file.

Take a look in the docs directory for the auto-generated API documentation.
